# SolidWorks Advanced Repository ðŸ”§âš™

Welcome to my *SolidWorks Advanced* repository! This repo showcases my advanced skills and expertise in SolidWorks, focusing on intricate part designs, assemblies, and simulations. Feel free to explore the files and see the work Iâ€™ve done.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- *Part Designs*: Detailed 3D models showcasing advanced techniques.

- *Assemblies*: Complex assemblies demonstrating the integration of multiple components.

- *Simulations*: Stress, motion, and thermal analysis for design optimization.

## ðŸš€ Skills Demonstrated
- *Advanced Part Modeling*: Using tools like Sweeps, Loft, and Surface Modeling.

- *Complex Assemblies*: Subassemblies, mates, and exploded views.

- *Finite Element Analysis (FEA)*: Stress, thermal, and motion simulations.

- *Design for Manufacturing*: Applying best practices to ensure the designs are production-ready.

## âš™ Requirements
- SolidWorks 2022 or higher

- Windows OS (for compatibility)

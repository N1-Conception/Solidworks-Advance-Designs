Features

Accurate Engineering Design

Developed with precise dimensions suitable for prototyping and manufacturing.

Assembly Ready

Includes mounting holes, flanged connections, and fuel/air passages for integration into a full carburetor assembly.

Parametric Modelling

Fully editable parametric design (created in SolidWorks) allowing easy modifications.


Applications

>Carbureted internal combustion engines (automotive & small engines)

>Educational projects and demonstrations

>Reverse engineering and prototyping

Flanged Multi-Port Connector 

A detailed SolidWorks model of a Flanged Multi-Port Connector, designed for use in fluid or gas piping systems where multiple branch connections are required. The design demonstrates advance-level SolidWorks features including revolve, extrude, cut, fillet, and circular patterning.

Features-

>Main cylindrical inlet/outlet with precise bore and mounting interface.

>Two lateral branch ports with flange faces and bolt holes.

>Base flange with bolt circle pattern for secure mounting.

>Filleted edges for stress reduction and aesthetics.

>Suitable for casting, machining, or 3D printing applications.

>Design is fully defined.

Y-Type Flanged Pipe Junction


Overview-

This project contains a Y-Type Flanged Pipe Junction modeled in SolidWorks. The part demonstrates intermediate-level 3D modeling skills, combining features such as:

Revolved boss/base

Extruded cuts

Fillets and chamfers

Circular patterns

Flanged pipe design with bolt hole arrays


Key Features-

Design intent: 

>A 3-way flanged connector commonly used in piping systems for fluid transport and distribution.

Flange standard: 

>Flange dimensions are modeled to resemble ANSI B16.5 (for representation purposes, not exact specification).

Parametric features: 

>Fully defined sketches and features for easy modification.



Requirements-

Software: SolidWorks 2018 or newer (Compatible with higher versions)

Skills: Intermediate SolidWorks user

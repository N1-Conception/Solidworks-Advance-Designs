# Exhaust Manifold â€” SolidWorks Design

## Overview

This repository contains a 3D CAD model of an *Exhaust Manifold* designed in *SolidWorks*.
  
The exhaust manifold is a crucial component in an internal combustion engine, responsible for collecting exhaust gases from multiple cylinders into a single pipe.



## Key Features

- 4-cylinder exhaust manifold geometry  

- Smooth runner profiles for optimized gas flow  

- Flange mounting holes for head attachment  

- Collector designed for efficient gas merging



## Applications

- Automotive engine design  

- Flow analysis and CFD simulations  

- Educational and training purposes in mechanical engineering




Parametric features: 

>Fully defined sketches and features for easy modification.



Requirements-

Software: SolidWorks 2018 or newer (Compatible with higher versions)

Skills: Advance SolidWorks user

# Vehicle Rim Design | SolidWorks Project

## Overview

This project showcases the 3D modeling and design of a *vehicle rim* created using *SolidWorks*. The design includes detailed features such as:

- Multi-layered rim profile

- Central mounting hub

- Bolt holes and air valve cavity

- Aesthetic cutouts for weight reduction


- *Techniques Used*:

  - Revolved Boss/Base

  - Cut-Extrude & Fillet

  - Reference Geometry: Planes and Sketches

  - Circular Pattern for bolt holes

  - RealView Graphics for rendering


## Project Goals

The goal of this model was to:

- Develop practical modeling skills in SolidWorks

- Simulate a real-world automotive component

- Apply mechanical design intent and symmetry

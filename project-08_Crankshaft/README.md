# Crankshaft | SolidWorks 3D Model

This repository contains a 3D model of a *Crankshaft, designed using **SolidWorks*. The model demonstrates the mechanical structure and function of a crankshaft typically found in internal combustion engines, highlighting its role in converting linear piston motion into rotational motion.

## Features

- Fully parametric design

- Designed for manufacturing reference

- Follows real-world crankshaft geometry

- Includes main journals, crankpins, webs, and counterweights


## Software & File Info

- *File Type:* .SLDPRT (SolidWorks Part file)

- *Estimated Modeling Time:* ~2 hours

## Applications

- Internal Combustion Engine Design

- Mechanical Motion Simulation

- Educational Demonstration of Rotational Mechanisms

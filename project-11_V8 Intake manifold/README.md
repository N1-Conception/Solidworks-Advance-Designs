🏁 V8 Engine Intake Manifold – CAD Model


📌 Project Overview

This project features a detailed Intake Manifold designed for a V8 engine configuration, created using SolidWorks. The intake manifold is a critical component in any internal combustion engine, responsible for evenly distributing the air-fuel mixture to the cylinders to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and power delivery.

🔧 Design Objectives

Accurately model the geometry of a V8 intake manifold.

Ensure realistic airflow pathways and symmetrical plenum design.

Design suitable mounting points for throttle body and cylinder head connections.

Follow real-world proportions and design cues from performance engines.


🧩 Features

Dual-plane intake geometry

Eight equal-length runners for consistent airflow

Central plenum chamber with smoothed transitions

Mounting flanges for cylinder heads and throttle body

Designed with SolidWorks parametric modeling
